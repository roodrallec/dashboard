# About Me

As a seasoned health-tech entrepreneur and consultant, I leverage technology to enhance employee wellbeing and streamline HR processes.

With over 10 years of experience, I co-founded Syndi Health to address the challenge of finding and implementing the right health and wellbeing benefits from a vast array of options. 

Previously, I was a Senior Data Scientist at Futr and the Founder & CTO of MAIV AI, where I led award-winning projects in computer vision and healthcare planning. My entrepreneurial journey began with Entrepreneur First, where I developed strong expertise in building and scaling startups.
